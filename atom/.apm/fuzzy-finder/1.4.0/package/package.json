Both of those config settings are interpreted as arrays of [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) glob patterns.\n\nThis package also will also not show Git ignored files when the `core.excludeVcsIgnoredPaths` is enabled.\n\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/671378/2241456/100db6b8-9cd3-11e3-9b3a-569c6b50cc60.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder#readme","_id":"fuzzy-finder@1.4.0","_shasum":"1921268fc9b7b50fc3ad57fc65d12e1f3333aca1","_resolved":"file:../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-1qhmzfz/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-1qhmzfz/package.tgz"}
