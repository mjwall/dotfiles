Encrypts and decrypts selected text.\n\n## Install\n\n### Dependencies\n\n  - gpg\n\n```bash\n$ apm install atom-gpg\n```\n\nOr install trough Atom Packages.\n\n## Settings\n\n  - **Gpg Executable**\n\n    Path to GPG binary. Defaults to 'gpg'\n\n  - **Gpg Home Dir**\n\n    Path to GPG key directory.\n\n  - **Gpg Recipients**\n\n    Recipient User IDs seperated by comma (,).
