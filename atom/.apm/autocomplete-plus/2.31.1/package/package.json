You don't have to do anything to install it.\n\n## Providers\n\n`autocomplete+` has a powerful autocomplete provider API, allowing provider authors to add language-specific behavior to this package.\n\nYou should *definitely* install additional providers (the default provider bundled with this package is somewhat crude): https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/wiki/Autocomplete-Providers\n\n## Usage\n\nJust type some stuff, and autocomplete+ will automatically show you some suggestions.\nPress `UP` and `DOWN` to select another suggestion, press `TAB` or `ENTER` to confirm your selection. You can change the default keymap in `Preferences`:\n\n* Keymap For Confirming A Suggestion\n\nAdditionally, the confirm keymap can be customized in your keymap.cson:\n\n```coffeescript\n'atom-text-editor.autocomplete-active':\n  'tab': 'unset!'\n  'ctrl-shift-a': 'autocomplete-plus:confirm'\n```\n\n### Remapping Movement Commands\n\nBy default, autocomplete-plus commandeers the editor's core movement commands when the suggestion list is open. You may want to change these movement commands to use your own keybindings.\n\nFirst you need to set the `autocomplete-plus.useCoreMovementCommands` setting to `false`, which you can do from the `autocomplete-plus` settings in the settings view.\n\n![core-movement](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69169/8839134/72a9c7e6-3087-11e5-9d1f-8d3d15961327.jpg)\n\nOr by adding this to your config file:\n\n```coffee\n\"*\":\n  \"autocomplete-plus\":\n    \"useCoreMovementCommands\": false\n```\n\nThen add these to your keymap file:\n\n```coffeescript\n'body atom-text-editor.autocomplete-active':\n  'ctrl-p': 'autocomplete-plus:move-up'\n  'ctrl-n': 'autocomplete-plus:move-down'\n  'pageup': 'autocomplete-plus:page-up'\n  'pagedown': 'autocomplete-plus:page-down'\n  'home': 'autocomplete-plus:move-to-top'\n  'end': 'autocomplete-plus:move-to-bottom'\n```\n\n## Features\n\n* Shows suggestions while typing\n* Includes a default provider (`SymbolProvider`):\n  * Wordlist generation happens when you open a file, while editing the file, and on save\n  * Suggestions are calculated using `fuzzaldrin`\n* Exposes a provider API which can be used to extend the functionality of the package and provide targeted / contextually correct suggestions\n* Disable autocomplete for file(s) via blacklisting, e.g. `*.md` to blacklist Markdown files\n* Disable autocomplete for editor scope(s) via blacklisting\n* Expands a snippet if an autocomplete+ provider includes one in a suggestion\n\n## Provider API\n\nGreat autocomplete depends on having great autocomplete providers. If there is not already a great provider for the language / grammar that you are working in, please consider creating a provider.\n\n[Read the `Provider API` documentation](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/wiki/Provider-API) to learn how to create a new autocomplete provider.\n\n## `SymbolProvider` Configuration\n\nIf the default `SymbolProvider` is missing useful information for the language / grammar you're working with, please take a look at the [`SymbolProvider` Config API](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/wiki/SymbolProvider-Config-API).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus#readme","_id":"autocomplete-plus@2.31.1","_shasum":"9fcb855840f6ff4ff0bc912b199a747590436f19","_resolved":"file:../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-1ush2ip/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-1ush2ip/package.tgz"}
