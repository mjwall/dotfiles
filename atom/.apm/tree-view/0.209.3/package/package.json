These icons are customizable by installing a package that provides an `atom.file-icons` service.\n\nThe `atom.file-icons` service must provide the following methods:\n\n* `iconClassForPath(path)` - Returns a CSS class name to add to the file view\n* `onWillDeactivate` - An event that lets the tree view return to its default icon strategy\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/tree-view/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/tree-view#readme","_id":"tree-view@0.209.3","_shasum":"427e93b9439d7562c4d8c0ce812b89c4cdb314e9","_resolved":"file:../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-ti88at/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-ti88at/package.tgz"}
