Icons by [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons).\n\n### Combine with other Syntax themes\n\nThere is a matching [Syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax), but most other Syntax themes work fine as well.\n\n![one-dark-ui + sepia](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/6979865/af2d59da-da24-11e4-8ab6-974c50534b86.png)\n> One dark + [Sepia](https://atom.io/themes/sepia-syntax)\n\n![one-dark-ui chester](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/6979876/cd0fca64-da24-11e4-9006-4f7e1ff80cad.png)\n> One dark + [Chester](https://atom.io/themes/chester-atom-syntax)\n\n### Install\n\nThis theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting \"One Dark\" from the __UI Themes__ drop-down menu.\n\n### Settings\n\n![Theme settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/15923548/cb3dc7ce-2e68-11e6-8a51-10801fb483bf.png)\n\nIn the theme settings you can change the __Font Size__ to scale the whole UI up or down.\n\nSwitch between 3 __Layout Modes__:\n\n1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.\n2. `Compact` - The UI stays compact to leave more space for the editor.\n3. `Spacious` - The UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.\n\nAnd pick a __Tab Sizing__ mode:\n\n1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode the tabs switch based on the window size.\n2. `Minimum` - In Mimimum mode the tabs will be as small as possible.\n3. `Even` - In Even mode all tabs will be the same size.\n\n### Customize\n\nIt's also possible to resize only certain areas by adding the following to your `styles.less` (Use the DevTools to find the right selectors):\n\n```css\n.theme-one-dark-ui {\n  .tab-bar { font-size: 18px; }\n  .tree-view { font-size: 14px; }\n  .status-bar { font-size: 12px; }\n}\n```\n\n### FAQ\n\n__Why do the colors change when I switch Syntax themes?__\nThis UI theme uses the same background color as the choosen Syntax theme. In case that Syntax theme has a light background color, it only uses its hue, but otherwise stays dark. This lets you use dark-light combos.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui#readme","_id":"one-dark-ui@1.6.0","_shasum":"57490dd2db3594de49abe1e3cb39b135000a6ed4","_resolved":"file:../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-1gijp51/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-1gijp51/package.tgz"}
