The service exposes one method, `resultsMarkerLayerForTextEditor`, which takes a `TextEditor` and returns a `TextEditorMarkerLayer` that you can interact with. Keep in mind that any work you do in synchronous event handlers on this layer will impact the performance of find and replace.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace#readme","_id":"find-and-replace@0.201.1","_shasum":"ff37fe7f086e5a6461ba4e6fd77407107e076531","_resolved":"file:../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-179j4df/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-179j4df/package.tgz"}
