Finally, all keybindings (including ones that community packages have added) are available in the _Keybindings_ section.\n\nWant to learn more?

You can still customize the UI in your `styles.less` file. For example:\n\n```css\n// Change the color of the titles\n.settings-view .section .section-heading {\n  color: white;\n}\n\n// Change the font size of the setting descriptions\n.settings-view .setting-description {\n  font-size: 13px;\n}\n```\n\nUse the [developer tools](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-creating-a-theme#developer-tools) to find more selectors.\n\n## Contributing\nAlways feel free to help out!
