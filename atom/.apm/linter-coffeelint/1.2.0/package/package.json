It will be used with files that have the “CoffeeScript” or “CoffeeScript (literate)” syntax.\n\n## Installation\nLinter package must be installed in order to use this plugin. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).\n\n### Plugin installation\n```\n$ apm install linter-coffeelint\n```\n\n## Settings\n\nAs of v0.2.0 there is no need to specify a path to coffeelint. If you need to use a specific version you can specify it in your project's `package.json` and `linter-coffeelint` will use that one. This is the same behavior the coffeelint commandline gives you.\n\nYour configuration belongs in your project, not your editor.\nhttps://github.com/clutchski/coffeelint/blob/master/doc/user.md\n\n## Contributing\nIf you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:\n\n1.
