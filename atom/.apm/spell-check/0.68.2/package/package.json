The Grammars config option is a list of scopes for which the package will check for spelling errors.\n\nTo enable _Spell Check_ for your current file type: put your cursor in the file, open the [Command Palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette)\n(<kbd>cmd-shift-p</kbd>), and run the `Editor: Log Cursor Scope` command. This will trigger a notification which will contain a list of scopes. The first scope that's listed is the one you should add to the list of scopes in the settings for the _Spell Check_ package. Here are some examples: `source.coffee`, `text.plain`, `text.html.basic`.\n\n## Changing the dictionary\n\nTo change the language of the dictionary, set the \"Locales\" configuration option to the IEFT tag (en-US, fr-FR, etc). More than one language can be used, simply separate them by commas.\n\nFor Windows 8 and 10, you must install the language using the regional settings before the language can be chosen inside Atom.\n\n## Plugins\n\n_Spell Check_ allows for plugins to provide additional spell checking functionality. See the `PLUGINS.md` file in the repository on how to write a plugin.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/spell-check/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/spell-check#readme","_id":"spell-check@0.68.2","_shasum":"41ea84f6eb8c327866492e1139da3ce95472b0f6","_resolved":"file:../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-r5pwnq/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../private/var/folders/2y/n9lzqm2x10lfxqm9n40xvfvw0000gn/T/d-116919-64102-r5pwnq/package.tgz"}
