;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Add the following to your .emacs file:
;; 
;; (push (substitute-in-file-name "path-to-ztree-directory") load-path)
;; (require 'ztree-dir)
;;
;; Call the ztree interactive function:
;; M-x ztree-dir
;; Open/close directories with double-click, Enter or Space keys

;; 1) Add some file-handling and marking abilities
