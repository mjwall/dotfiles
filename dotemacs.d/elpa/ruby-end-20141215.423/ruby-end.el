;;; Commentary:

;; ruby-end is a minor mode for Emacs that can be used with ruby-mode
;; to automatically close blocks by inserting "end" when typing a
;; block-keyword, followed by a space.
;;
;; To use ruby-end-mode, make sure that this file is in Emacs load-path:
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/directory/or/file")
;;
;; Then require ruby-end:
;;   (require 'ruby-end)
;;
;; ruby-end-mode is automatically started in ruby-mode.
