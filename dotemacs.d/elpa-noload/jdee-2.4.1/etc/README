Welcome to the Java IDE for Emacs, an Emacs-based integrated development
environment for developing Java applications. Features include:

  * source code editing with syntax highlighting,
    auto indentation using the native GNU Emacs Java mode

  * Symbol completion (jde-complete-in-line)

  * Code generation: templates, import insertion/deletion/ordering
    etc.

  * browse JDK doc, using the browser of your choice
    (jde-help-symbol and jde-help-docsets)

  * browse your source code (jde-find-class* and semantic integration)

  * compilation with automatic jump from error messages
    to responsible line in the source code using ant
    (jde-ant-build).

  * run Java application in an interactive (comint)
    Emacs buffer

  * integrated debugging with interactive debug
    command buffer and automatic display of
    current source file/line when stepping through code
    (jde-debug)

  * supports Oracle/OpenJDK Java 7

  * runs on any platform supported by GNU Emacs 23.4 and later

  * easily and infinitely customizable

To install, please read install.html in this directory.

Known issues:

  * Static imports don't quite work

  * Limited support for Java template beyond basic highlighting,
    parsing, and indenting.

  * Indentation after an annotation might be unexpected

  * It's a little crufty after all these years - patches welcome :-)
